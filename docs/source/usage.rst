Installation
------------

Currently, you can install PhysiCell Studio using one of two ways: 

* download a Release of just the Studio Python code from https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/PhysiCell-model-builder/releases. This assumes you have a Python distribution with the appropriate modules installed that are needed by the Studio. Refer to the README there.

* download a standalone, bundled (.zip) package which includes a Python distributiion and the required modules and platform-dependent libraries. We provide a package for Windows and Mac. Currently, those are hosted at: 

    * https://www.dropbox.com/s/wiwdd09f8pmmyyk/PhysiCell_Studio_win.zip?dl=0 (Windows)

    * https://www.dropbox.com/s/b8vr54p5hg3pg4n/PhysiCell_Studio_mac.zip?dl=0 (Mac version)
